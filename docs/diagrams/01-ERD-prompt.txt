IMPORTANT NOTES:

1. USER Inheritance: Uses Table Per Hierarchy (TPH) pattern with discriminator column "UserType"
   - All user types (User, Guest, Admin, Staff) stored in single Users table
   - Discriminator values: "User", "Guest", "Admin", "Staff"
   - Guest, Admin, Staff inherit all User attributes

2. Amenities Storage: 
   - Amenities are stored as comma-separated string in AccommodationType.Amenities field
   - NO junction tables (CAMPSITE_AMENITY, ACCOMMODATION_TYPE_AMENITY do NOT exist)
   - This is a denormalized approach for simplicity

3. Value Objects: Some attributes use value objects (Email, Money, DateRange, BookingStatus, PaymentStatus)
   - Stored in database as their underlying types (VARCHAR, DECIMAL, DATETIME, VARCHAR)
   - Converted to/from value objects by EF Core converters

4. Strongly-Typed IDs: All entities use strongly-typed IDs (BookingId, UserId, etc.)
   - Stored in database as INT
   - Converted to/from strongly-typed IDs by EF Core converters

5. Table Names: Use exact table names from database
   - SeasonalPricings (plural, not "Pricing")
   - All other tables use singular names

DIAGRAM REQUIREMENTS:
- Use standard ERD notation (Crow's Foot / IE notation)
- Draw rectangles for each entity
- Draw lines connecting related entities
- Use Crow's foot notation symbols for cardinality:
  * | (one) - single line
  * || (many) - crow's foot (three lines)
  * O (optional/zero) - circle
  * |O (zero or one) - single line with circle
  * ||O (zero or many) - crow's foot with circle
- Mark primary keys with (PK) label
- Mark foreign keys with (FK) label
- Show Table Per Hierarchy (TPH) inheritance pattern for User entity:
  * Draw USER entity with discriminator column "UserType"
  * Show GUEST, ADMIN, STAFF as subtypes connected to USER with inheritance arrow
  * Label discriminator values: "User", "Guest", "Admin", "Staff"
- Add note: "Amenities stored as comma-separated TEXT field, NOT junction tables"
- Use different colors for different entity types (optional but helpful)
- Group related entities together

I need a System Architecture Diagram showing the complete deployment architecture for a campsite booking system with Docker containers.

Please create a layered architecture diagram with 4 tiers:

TIER 1 - CLIENT TIER (Top):
- Web Browser
  * Blazor Server UI (server-side rendering)
  * HTTPS connection
  * Port: 443 (if using Nginx) or 7001 (direct)
  
- API Testing Tools
  * Postman
  * Swagger UI (available at /swagger when in development)

TIER 2 - API GATEWAY TIER (OPTIONAL):
- YARP API Gateway Container (OPTIONAL - Separate Project)
  * Technology: .NET 9.0 + YARP 2.1.0
  * Ports: 8000 (HTTP), 8001 (HTTPS)
  * Status: OPTIONAL - Main app works without it
  * Features (if enabled):
    - Load Balancing (RoundRobin)
    - Health Checks (every 10s)
    - Request Routing
  * Routes (if enabled):
    - /api/bookings → BookMyHome API
    - /api/users → BookMyHome API
    - /api/auth → BookMyHome API
    - /api/campsites → BookMyHome API
    - /swagger → BookMyHome API

NOTE: API Gateway is a separate project (ApiGateway/) and is NOT required. Main application runs directly on port 7001.

TIER 3 - APPLICATION TIER:
- BookMyHome API (Main Application)
  * Technology: .NET 9.0 + ASP.NET Core + Blazor Server
  * Port: 7001 (HTTPS), 5000 (HTTP)
  * Features: 
    - REST API (Controllers/)
    - Blazor Server UI (Components/)
    - JWT Authentication
    - Cookie Authentication
    - Swagger/OpenAPI documentation
    - Kafka Producer (active)
    - Kafka Consumer (DISABLED - see Program.cs:227)
  
NOTE: Single instance by default. Multiple instances possible but not default configuration.

TIER 4 - DATA TIER:
- MySQL Database Container
  * Image: mysql:8.0
  * Port: 3306
  * Volume: mysql_data (persistent storage)
  * Database: CampsiteBookingDb
  * Tables: 24+ entities
  
- Kafka Broker Container
  * Image: confluentinc/cp-kafka:7.5.0
  * Port: 9092
  * Topic: bookmyhome.events (SINGLE TOPIC for all events)
  * Note: Events published but not consumed (consumer disabled)
  
- Zookeeper Container
  * Image: confluentinc/cp-zookeeper:7.5.0
  * Port: 2181
  * Purpose: Kafka coordination

INFRASTRUCTURE LAYER (Bottom):
- Docker Compose
  * Orchestrates all containers
  * Manages networks and volumes
  
- Nginx Reverse Proxy (Optional)
  * Ports: 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS)
  * SSL/TLS termination
  * DDoS protection
  * Rate limiting

NETWORKS:
- bookmyhome-network (Bridge network)
  * Connects all containers
  * Internal DNS resolution

VOLUMES:
- mysql_data (persistent)
  * Stores MySQL database files

CONNECTIONS (show with arrows):

1. Browser → BookMyHome API (Direct, HTTPS port 7001)
   OR
   Browser → API Gateway (Optional, HTTPS port 8001) → BookMyHome API

2. [If Gateway Enabled] API Gateway → BookMyHome API (HTTPS, port 7001)
   Load Balancing: RoundRobin (if multiple instances)

3. BookMyHome API → MySQL (TCP, port 3306, EF Core)
   Connection: Entity Framework Core with MySQL provider

4. BookMyHome API → Kafka Producer → Kafka Broker (TCP, port 9092)
   Topic: bookmyhome.events
   Status: ACTIVE (events are published)

5. [Kafka Consumer - DISABLED]
   Kafka Broker → [Consumer would be here but is disabled]
   Show with dashed line and "DISABLED" label

6. Kafka → Zookeeper (TCP, port 2181)
   Coordination and cluster management

VISUAL STYLE:
- Use boxes/rectangles for containers
- Use different colors for different tiers
- Show port numbers on connections
- Use solid arrows for active connections
- Use dashed arrows for optional/disabled components
- Mark API Gateway as "OPTIONAL" with dashed box
- Mark Kafka Consumer as "DISABLED" with red X
- Group containers by tier with labeled sections
- Add Docker logo to show containerization
- Add technology stack labels (e.g., ".NET 9.0", "MySQL 8.0")

LEGEND:
- Solid line = Active connection
- Dashed line = Optional/disabled connection
- Blue boxes = Application containers
- Green boxes = Data containers
- Orange boxes = Infrastructure containers
- Red X = Disabled component
- ⚠️ = Warning/optional component

STATUS INDICATORS:
- ✅ BookMyHome API: ACTIVE
- ✅ Kafka Producer: ACTIVE
- ✅ MySQL: ACTIVE
- ✅ Kafka Broker: ACTIVE
- ❌ Kafka Consumer: DISABLED
- ⚠️ API Gateway: OPTIONAL
- ⚠️ Nginx: OPTIONAL

ADDITIONAL NOTES:
- Main application works without API Gateway
- Kafka events are published but not consumed
- Single Kafka topic: bookmyhome.events
- All events go to same topic (event type in message key)

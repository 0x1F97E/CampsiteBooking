   - Primary key indexes
   - Foreign key indexes
   - Query optimization
   
✅ Async/Await
   - Non-blocking I/O
   - Async database operations
   - Async API endpoints
   
✅ Load Balancing
   - YARP RoundRobin

BRANCH 6 - PLUS (+) (Additional constraints):
Color: Gray

Design Constraints:
✅ Clean Architecture
✅ Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
✅ SOLID Principles
✅ Repository Pattern

Implementation Constraints:
✅ .NET 9.0
✅ C# 12

✅ MySQL 8.0

Interface Constraints:
✅ REST API (Level 2)
✅ Swagger/OpenAPI
✅ JSON data format
✅ JWT authentication

Physical Constraints:
✅ Docker containers
✅ MySQL database
✅ Kafka message broker
✅ YARP API Gateway

LEGEND (add at bottom):
✅ Green checkmark = Fully implemented
⚠️ Yellow warning = Partially implemented
❌ Red X = Not implemented

VISUAL STYLE:
- Use different colors for each main branch
- Make implemented features larger/bolder
- Use icons where appropriate (e.g., lock for security, speed gauge for performance)
- Connect all branches to the center node
- Use sub-branches for detailed features
- Add status indicators (✅, ⚠️, ❌) to each feature

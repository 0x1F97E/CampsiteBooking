BRANCH 6 - PLUS (+) (Additional constraints):
Color: Gray

Design Constraints:

⚠️ YARP API Gateway (optional/separate)

LEGEND (add at bottom):
✅ Green checkmark = Fully implemented
⚠️ Yellow warning = Partially implemented or not functional
❌ Red X = Not implemented

VISUAL STYLE:
- Use different colors for each main branch
- Make implemented features larger/bolder
- Use icons where appropriate (e.g., lock for security, speed gauge for performance)
- Connect all branches to the center node
- Use sub-branches for detailed features
- Add status indicators (✅, ⚠️, ❌) to each feature
- Mark non-functional features clearly (email/SMS notifications)

I need a Clean Architecture (Onion Architecture) diagram showing the layered structure of a .NET campsite booking system called "BookMyHome".

SYSTEM CONTEXT:
- .NET 9.0 application with Blazor Server UI
- Domain-Driven Design (DDD) with Clean Architecture
- MySQL 8.0 database with Entity Framework Core
- Kafka event streaming (producer active, consumer disabled)
- Optional YARP API Gateway

Please create concentric circles (like an onion) with 4 layers from innermost to outermost.

Please create concentric circles (like an onion) with 4 layers:

LAYER 1 - DOMAIN LAYER (Innermost Circle - Core):
Color: Dark Blue
Contains:
- Entities (24+ entities)
  * Booking (AggregateRoot)
  * User (AggregateRoot, base class)
  * Guest (inherits User)
  * Admin (inherits User)
  * Staff (inherits User)
  * Campsite (AggregateRoot)
  * AccommodationType
  * AccommodationSpot
  * Payment (Entity, NOT AggregateRoot - cannot raise events)
  * Review
  * Amenity
  * AmenityLookup
  * Availability
  * SeasonalPricing
  * Discount
  * PeripheralPurchase
  * PurchaseOption
  * Photo
  * Event
  * EventRegistration
  * Newsletter
  * NewsletterSubscription
  * NewsletterAnalytics
  * MaintenanceTask
  
- Value Objects
  * Email
  * Money
  * DateRange
  * BookingStatus (value object with transition rules)
  * PaymentStatus (value object with transition rules)
  
- Domain Events
  * BookingCreatedEvent (RAISED in Booking.Create())
  * BookingConfirmedEvent (RAISED in Booking.Confirm())
  * BookingCancelledEvent (RAISED in Booking.Cancel())
  * UserCreatedEvent (RAISED in User.Create())
  * UserDeactivatedEvent (RAISED in User.Deactivate())
  * PaymentCompletedEvent (EXISTS but NEVER RAISED - Payment is Entity, not AggregateRoot)
  * PaymentRefundedEvent (EXISTS but NEVER RAISED - Payment is Entity, not AggregateRoot)
  
- Repository Interfaces
  * IBookingRepository
  * IUserRepository
  * ICampsiteRepository
  
- Strongly-Typed IDs
  * BookingId, PaymentId, UserId, GuestId, AdminId, StaffId
  * CampsiteId, AccommodationTypeId, AccommodationSpotId
  * And all other entity IDs (24+ total)

- Common Base Classes
  * Entity<TId>
  * AggregateRoot<TId>
  * ValueObject

LAYER 2 - APPLICATION LAYER (Second Circle):
Color: Light Blue
Contains:
- Application Services
  * UnitOfWork (IUnitOfWork, UnitOfWork) - Transaction management
  * PricingService (IPricingService) - Seasonal pricing calculations
  * DashboardService (IDashboardService) - Analytics and reporting
  
- DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)
  * BookingDto
  * UserDto
  * CampsiteDto
  * AuthDto
  * CreateBookingRequest
  * UpdateBookingRequest
  * RegisterRequest
  * LoginRequest
  
- Event Handlers (Interfaces)
  * IEventHandler
  * NotificationEventHandler (implementation in Infrastructure)

NOTE: KafkaProducer and KafkaConsumer are in Infrastructure layer, not Application layer.

LAYER 3 - INFRASTRUCTURE LAYER (Third Circle):
Color: Green
Contains:
- Persistence
  * CampsiteBookingDbContext (EF Core)
  * BookingRepository (IBookingRepository implementation)
  * UserRepository (IUserRepository implementation)
  * CampsiteRepository (ICampsiteRepository implementation)
  * EF Core Value Object Converters
  * EF Core Strongly-Typed ID Converters
  
- External Services
  * KafkaProducer (IKafkaProducer) - Publishes events to Kafka
  * KafkaConsumer (BackgroundService) - ⚠️ DISABLED (commented out in Program.cs:227)
  * EmailService (IEmailService) - SMTP email sending
  * SMSService (ISMSService) - SMS notifications
  * MockPaymentService - Payment processing (mock implementation)
  * StripePaymentService - Payment processing (Stripe integration, optional)
  
- Security
  * InputValidator - XSS protection
  * JWT Token Generation (in AuthController)
  * Password Hashing (ASP.NET Core Identity PasswordHasher)
  
- Event Handlers (Implementation)
  * NotificationEventHandler - Handles domain events (not called - consumer disabled)
  
- Database
  * MySQL 8.0

LAYER 4 - PRESENTATION LAYER (Outermost Circle):
Color: Orange
Contains:
- Web UI
  * Blazor Server Components (Components/Pages/)
  * Razor Pages (Pages/)
  * MudBlazor Components (UI library)
  * Layout Components (MainLayout, NavMenu, Footer)
  
- API Controllers
  * BookingsController (REST API)
  * UsersController (REST API)
  * CampsitesController (REST API)
  * AuthController (REST API - Register, Login with JWT)
  
- Authentication
  * AuthenticationService
  * ServerAuthenticationStateProvider
  * AuthenticationCircuitHandler
  * Cookie Authentication (for Blazor UI)
  * JWT Bearer Authentication (for REST API)
  
- API Gateway (OPTIONAL - Separate Project)
  * YARP Reverse Proxy (ApiGateway/ project)
  * Note: Optional/separate, not integrated into main application
  * Can be run separately on port 8001

DEPENDENCY RULE:
- Draw arrows pointing INWARD from outer layers to inner layers
- Add text: "Dependencies point inward - outer layers depend on inner layers, NEVER the reverse"
- Show that Domain Layer has NO dependencies on other layers
- Show that Application Layer only depends on Domain Layer
- Show that Infrastructure Layer depends on Domain + Application Layers
- Show that Presentation Layer depends on all inner layers

COMPONENT STATUS INDICATORS:
- Add ⚠️ symbol to KafkaConsumer (disabled)
- Add ⚠️ symbol to PaymentCompletedEvent, PaymentRefundedEvent (exist but not raised)
- Mark API Gateway as "Optional/Separate"

ADDITIONAL NOTES:
- Label the center as "DOMAIN CORE - Business Logic"
- Add a legend showing the dependency direction
- Use different colors for each layer
- Make the Domain Layer (center) the most prominent
- Add small icons or symbols to represent different component types
- Show that Payment entity cannot raise events (it's Entity, not AggregateRoot)
- Note that Kafka Consumer is implemented but disabled

This diagram should clearly demonstrate the Clean Architecture principle where:
1. Business logic is isolated in the center
2. Dependencies flow inward
3. Inner layers know nothing about outer layers
4. The domain is independent of frameworks, UI, and databases
5. Domain events are raised only by AggregateRoot entities
6. Infrastructure handles external concerns (database, messaging, email)

I need a 3D Scale Cube diagram showing the three dimensions of scaling for a campsite booking system.

Please create a 3D cube with three axes (X, Y, Z) representing different scaling strategies:

X-AXIS (Horizontal Duplication / Cloning):
Label: "X-Axis: Horizontal Scaling (Cloning)"
Description: Running multiple identical instances of the application

Current Implementation: ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- Show 3 identical boxes labeled:
  * "BookMyHome API Instance 1" (Port 7001)
  * "BookMyHome API Instance 2" (Port 7002)
  * "BookMyHome API Instance 3" (Port 7003)
- Add a load balancer box above them labeled "YARP API Gateway"
- Show arrows from load balancer to each instance
- Add text: "RoundRobin Load Balancing"

Benefits:
- Increased throughput
- High availability
- Fault tolerance
- Simple to implement

Example: "3x API instances behind YARP load balancer"

Y-AXIS (Functional Decomposition / Microservices):
Label: "Y-Axis: Functional Scaling (Microservices)"
Description: Splitting application by function/service

Current Implementation: ⚠️ PARTIAL (Modular Monolith)
- Show separate service boxes:
  * "Booking Service" (handles bookings)
  * "User Service" (handles users)
  * "Payment Service" (handles payments)
  * "Notification Service" (handles emails/SMS)
  * "Campsite Service" (handles campsites)
- Show each service with its own database
- Add text: "Currently: Modular Monolith with separate Kafka Consumer"

Benefits:
- Independent deployment
- Technology diversity
- Team autonomy
- Fault isolation

Example: "Separate microservices for each domain"

Z-AXIS (Data Partitioning / Sharding):
Label: "Z-Axis: Data Scaling (Sharding)"
Description: Splitting data by some attribute (e.g., region, customer)

Current Implementation: ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED
- Show database sharding by region:
  * "Shard 1: Nordjylland" (Northern Denmark)
  * "Shard 2: Midtjylland" (Central Denmark)
  * "Shard 3: Syddanmark" (Southern Denmark)
  * "Shard 4: Sjælland" (Zealand)
- Show routing logic box labeled "Shard Router"
- Add text: "Future: Shard by campsite region"

Benefits:
- Reduced database load
- Improved query performance
- Geographic distribution
- Data locality

Example: "Partition bookings by campsite region"

VISUAL LAYOUT:
- Draw a 3D cube with visible X, Y, Z axes
- Place X-axis horizontally (left to right)
- Place Y-axis vertically (bottom to top)
- Place Z-axis in depth (front to back)
- Use different colors for each axis:
  * X-axis: Green (implemented)
  * Y-axis: Yellow (partial)
  * Z-axis: Red (not implemented)

CURRENT STATE SUMMARY (add as text box):
✅ X-Axis: IMPLEMENTED
   - 3 API instances
   - YARP load balancer
   - RoundRobin distribution

⚠️ Y-Axis: PARTIAL
   - Modular monolith architecture
   - Separate Kafka consumer service
   - Ready for microservices split

❌ Z-Axis: NOT IMPLEMENTED
   - Single MySQL database
   - No sharding
   - Future enhancement

SCALING STRATEGY:
Add a text box explaining the chosen strategy:
"BookMyHome uses X-axis scaling (horizontal duplication) as the primary scaling strategy. This provides immediate benefits with minimal complexity. Y-axis scaling (microservices) is prepared through modular architecture. Z-axis scaling (sharding) is not needed at current scale but can be added when database becomes a bottleneck."

LEGEND:
- ✅ Green = Implemented
- ⚠️ Yellow = Partially implemented
- ❌ Red = Not implemented
- Arrows = Data flow / requests
- Boxes = Services / databases

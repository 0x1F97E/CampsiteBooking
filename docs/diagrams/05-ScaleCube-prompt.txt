I need a 3D Scale Cube diagram showing the three dimensions of scaling for a campsite booking system.

Please create a 3D cube with three axes (X, Y, Z) representing different scaling strategies:

X-AXIS (Horizontal Duplication / Cloning):
Label: "X-Axis: Horizontal Scaling (Cloning)"
Description: Running multiple identical instances of the application

Current Implementation: ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Ready)
- Show 3 identical boxes labeled:
  * "BookMyHome API Instance 1" (Port 7001)
  * "BookMyHome API Instance 2" (Port 7002)
  * "BookMyHome API Instance 3" (Port 7003)
- Add a load balancer box above them labeled "YARP API Gateway (Optional)" or "Nginx"
- Show arrows from load balancer to each instance
- Add text: "RoundRobin Load Balancing"
- Note: Single instance by default, multiple instances possible

Benefits:
- Increased throughput
- High availability
- Fault tolerance
- Simple to implement

Example: "3x API instances behind load balancer (when scaled)"

Y-AXIS (Functional Decomposition / Microservices):
Label: "Y-Axis: Functional Scaling (Microservices)"
Description: Splitting application by function/service

Current Implementation: ⚠️ PARTIAL (Modular Monolith)
- Show single monolith box:
  * "BookMyHome Monolith" (contains all services)
  * Contains: Booking, User, Campsite, Payment controllers
- Show separate service box (but note it's disabled):
  * "Kafka Consumer Service" (DISABLED - see Program.cs:227)
- Add text: "Currently: Modular Monolith"
- Add text: "Kafka Consumer exists but is disabled"
- Note: No true microservices - all in single deployment unit

Benefits (if implemented):
- Independent deployment
- Technology diversity
- Team autonomy
- Fault isolation

Current Status:
- ❌ NOT true microservices
- ✅ Modular controllers (logical separation)
- ✅ Event-driven architecture (Kafka producer active)
- ⚠️ Consumer disabled (not separate service)

Z-AXIS (Data Partitioning / Sharding):
Label: "Z-Axis: Data Scaling (Sharding)"
Description: Splitting data by some attribute (e.g., region, customer)

Current Implementation: ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED
- Show single database box:
  * "MySQL Database" (CampsiteBookingDb)
  * All data in single database
- Add text: "Single database - no sharding"
- Note: "Not needed at current scale"

Potential Sharding Strategy (Future):
- Show database sharding by region:
  * "Shard 1: Nordjylland" (Northern Denmark)
  * "Shard 2: Midtjylland" (Central Denmark)
  * "Shard 3: Syddanmark" (Southern Denmark)
  * "Shard 4: Sjælland" (Zealand)
- Show routing logic box labeled "Shard Router"
- Add text: "Future: Shard by campsite region"

Benefits (if implemented):
- Reduced database load
- Improved query performance
- Geographic distribution
- Data locality

Example: "Partition bookings by campsite region (future enhancement)"

VISUAL LAYOUT:
- Draw a 3D cube with visible X, Y, Z axes
- Place X-axis horizontally (left to right)
- Place Y-axis vertically (bottom to top)
- Place Z-axis in depth (front to back)
- Use different colors for each axis:
  * X-axis: Green (implemented/ready)
  * Y-axis: Yellow (partial - modular monolith)
  * Z-axis: Red (not implemented)

CURRENT STATE SUMMARY (add as text box):
✅ X-Axis: READY (can scale horizontally)
   - Single instance by default
   - Multiple instances possible with load balancer
   - Stateless API (JWT authentication)
   - Docker Compose supports scaling

⚠️ Y-Axis: PARTIAL (Modular Monolith)
   - Single deployment unit
   - Modular controllers (logical separation)
   - Event-driven elements (Kafka producer)
   - Consumer disabled (not separate service)
   - NOT true microservices

❌ Z-Axis: NOT IMPLEMENTED
   - Single MySQL database
   - No sharding
   - Not needed at current scale
   - Future enhancement if needed

SCALING STRATEGY:
Add a text box explaining the chosen strategy:
"BookMyHome uses X-axis scaling (horizontal duplication) as the primary scaling strategy. This provides immediate benefits with minimal complexity. The application is a modular monolith with event-driven elements (Kafka producer). Y-axis scaling (microservices) is not implemented - all services are in a single deployment unit. Z-axis scaling (sharding) is not needed at current scale but can be added when database becomes a bottleneck."

LEGEND:
- ✅ Green = Implemented/Ready
- ⚠️ Yellow = Partially implemented
- ❌ Red = Not implemented
- Arrows = Data flow / requests
- Boxes = Services / databases

ADDITIONAL NOTES:
- Application is stateless (JWT tokens, no session state)
- Database is shared across all instances
- Kafka events published but not consumed (consumer disabled)
- Scaling strategy focuses on X-axis (horizontal duplication)

I need a UML Use Case Diagram for a campsite booking system. Please create it with standard UML notation.

ACTORS:

1. Guest (stick figure) - Primary actor, unregistered visitor
2. Registered User (stick figure) - Extends Guest, logged-in user
3. Admin (stick figure) - Extends Registered User, system administrator
4. System (stick figure) - Automated background processes

USE CASES:

For Guest (unregistered):
- Search Campsites
- View Campsite Details
- View Accommodation Types
- View Availability Calendar
- View Pricing Information
- Register Account

For Registered User (logged-in):
- Login
- Logout
- Create Booking
- View My Bookings
- Update Booking Details
- Cancel Booking
- Make Payment
- Write Review
- Subscribe to Newsletter
- View Notifications
- Update Profile

For Admin:
- Manage Campsites (CRUD)
- Manage Accommodation Types (CRUD)
- Manage Amenities (CRUD)
- Manage Pricing Rules
- View All Bookings
- View Analytics Dashboard
- Manage Users
- Send Notifications

For System (automated):
- Send Booking Confirmation Email
- Send Payment Receipt Email
- Send Cancellation Email
- Process Scheduled Notifications
- Update Availability
- Generate Reports

RELATIONSHIPS:

<<include>> relationships (mandatory):
- "Login" includes "Authenticate User"
- "Create Booking" includes "Check Availability"
- "Create Booking" includes "Calculate Total Price"
- "Make Payment" includes "Process Payment Gateway"
- "Cancel Booking" includes "Process Refund"

<<extend>> relationships (optional):
- "Send Booking Confirmation Email" extends "Create Booking"
- "Send Payment Receipt Email" extends "Make Payment"
- "Send Cancellation Email" extends "Cancel Booking"
- "Write Review" extends "View My Bookings"
- "Subscribe to Newsletter" extends "Register Account"

Generalization (inheritance):
- Registered User generalizes Guest (Registered User is-a Guest)
- Admin generalizes Registered User (Admin is-a Registered User)

SYSTEM BOUNDARY:
- Draw a rectangle labeled "BookMyHome Campsite Booking System"
- All use cases should be inside this boundary
- Actors should be outside the boundary

NOTATION:
- Use stick figures for actors
- Use ovals for use cases
- Use solid lines for associations (actor to use case)
- Use dashed arrows with <<include>> for include relationships
- Use dashed arrows with <<extend>> for extend relationships
- Use solid arrows with hollow triangle for generalization

Please arrange the diagram with:
- Actors on the left side
- Use cases in the center (inside system boundary)
- Group related use cases together
- Show all relationships clearly

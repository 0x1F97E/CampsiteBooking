I need a UML Use Case Diagram for a campsite booking system called "BookMyHome". 

SYSTEM CONTEXT:
- Campsite booking and management system
- Built with .NET 9.0, Blazor Server, MySQL 8.0
- REST API with JWT authentication
- Event-driven architecture (Kafka producer active, consumer disabled)

Please create the diagram using standard UML Use Case notation.

ACTORS:

1. Guest (stick figure) - Primary actor, unregistered visitor
2. Registered User (stick figure) - Extends Guest, logged-in user (Guest role)
3. Admin (stick figure) - Extends Registered User, system administrator
4. Staff (stick figure) - Extends Registered User, campsite staff member
5. System (stick figure) - Automated background processes

USE CASES:

For Guest (unregistered):
- Search Campsites
- View Campsite Details
- View Accommodation Types
- View Accommodation Spots
- View Availability Calendar
- View Pricing Information
- View Seasonal Pricing
- Register Account

For Registered User (logged-in Guest):
- Login
- Logout
- Create Booking
- View My Bookings
- View Booking Details
- Update Booking Details (special requests)
- Cancel Booking
- Make Payment
- Write Review
- Subscribe to Newsletter
- Unsubscribe from Newsletter
- View Notifications
- Update Profile
- Change Password

For Admin:
- Manage Campsites (CRUD)
- Manage Accommodation Types (CRUD)
- Manage Accommodation Spots (CRUD)
- Manage Amenities
- Manage Seasonal Pricing Rules
- Manage Discounts
- Manage Purchase Options
- View All Bookings
- View Analytics Dashboard
- Manage Users (Guest, Admin, Staff)
- Manage Reviews (approve/reject)
- Manage Events
- Manage Newsletters
- Send Notifications
- Manage Maintenance Tasks

For Staff:
- View Bookings (for assigned campsite)
- Check In Guest
- Check Out Guest
- View Campsite Information
- Update Booking Status

For System (automated):
- Send Booking Confirmation Email ⚠️ (NOT FUNCTIONAL - Consumer disabled)
- Send Payment Receipt Email ⚠️ (NOT FUNCTIONAL - Consumer disabled)
- Send Cancellation Email ⚠️ (NOT FUNCTIONAL - Consumer disabled)
- Send Welcome Email ⚠️ (NOT FUNCTIONAL - Consumer disabled)
- Send SMS Notifications ⚠️ (NOT FUNCTIONAL - Consumer disabled)
- Process Scheduled Newsletters (Implemented - Newsletter entity supports scheduling)
- Update Availability (Implemented - Availability entity exists)

NOTE: System use cases marked with ⚠️ are implemented but NOT FUNCTIONAL because Kafka Consumer is disabled (see Program.cs:227). Email/SMS services exist but are not called automatically.

RELATIONSHIPS:

<<include>> relationships (mandatory):
- "Login" includes "Authenticate User"
- "Create Booking" includes "Check Availability"
- "Create Booking" includes "Calculate Total Price"
- "Create Booking" includes "Validate Dates"
- "Make Payment" includes "Process Payment Gateway"
- "Cancel Booking" includes "Release Accommodation Spot"
- "Register Account" includes "Validate Email Format"

<<extend>> relationships (optional):
- "Send Booking Confirmation Email" extends "Create Booking" ⚠️ (NOT FUNCTIONAL)
- "Send Payment Receipt Email" extends "Make Payment" ⚠️ (NOT FUNCTIONAL)
- "Send Cancellation Email" extends "Cancel Booking" ⚠️ (NOT FUNCTIONAL)
- "Send Welcome Email" extends "Register Account" ⚠️ (NOT FUNCTIONAL)
- "Write Review" extends "View My Bookings"
- "Subscribe to Newsletter" extends "Register Account"
- "Update Booking Details" extends "View My Bookings"

Generalization (inheritance):
- Registered User generalizes Guest (Registered User is-a Guest)
- Admin generalizes Registered User (Admin is-a Registered User)
- Staff generalizes Registered User (Staff is-a Registered User)

SYSTEM BOUNDARY:
- Draw a rectangle labeled "BookMyHome Campsite Booking System"
- All use cases should be inside this boundary
- Actors should be outside the boundary

NOTATION:
- Use stick figures for actors
- Use ovals for use cases
- Use solid lines for associations (actor to use case)
- Use dashed arrows with <<include>> for include relationships
- Use dashed arrows with <<extend>> for extend relationships
- Use solid arrows with hollow triangle for generalization
- Mark non-functional use cases with ⚠️ symbol or different color (red/yellow)

Please arrange the diagram with:
- Actors on the left side
- Use cases in the center (inside system boundary)
- Group related use cases together
- Show all relationships clearly
- Clearly mark which system use cases are not functional

ADDITIONAL NOTES:
- System use cases for email/SMS are implemented in code but Kafka Consumer is disabled
- Email and SMS services exist and can be called manually, but not automatically
- Newsletter scheduling is functional (Newsletter entity supports scheduled sending)
- Availability updates are functional (Availability entity exists and can be updated)
